# Dia-Duit
I'm a technical writer based in Cork, Ireland. 
I am also a writer of non-fiction, literary criticism, and any other topic that interests me.
I'm a big fan of information environmentalism, and making the web, open and accessible to everyone.
In my spare time, I'm a gamer, gardener, and constant reader. 
I'm a Wikipedian with an interest in women in red and art+feminism wiki projects. I'm a member of the Wikimedia Community Ireland and I have a special interest in increasing the use and acceptance of Wikipedia in education.
From time to time, I volunteer for the Cork LGBT Archive, mainly reviewing metadata, proofing and editing arcival submissions, and ageneral advice and support.
